## Important Note on Data Size
The current dataset contains only 5 orders. This is sufficient to demonstrate the ETL pipeline but **insufficient for meaningful business analysis**. Statistical tests and country comparisons should not be performed until more data is collected.

## To Get Meaningful Results
1. Run the pipeline with a larger dataset (100+ orders)
2. Ensure all orders have proper date assignments
3. Extend date range to include multiple weeks/months
